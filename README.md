+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

Table: EmployeeUNI

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| unique_id     | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(id, unique_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the corresponding unique id of an employee in the company.
 

Write a solution to show the unique ID of each user, If a user does not have a unique ID replace just show null.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Alice    |
| 7  | Bob      |
| 11 | Meir     |
| 90 | Winston  |
| 3  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
EmployeeUNI table:
+----+-----------+
| id | unique_id |
+----+-----------+
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |
+----+-----------+
Output: 
+-----------+----------+
| unique_id | name     |
+-----------+----------+
| null      | Alice    |
| null      | Bob      |
| 2         | Meir     |
| 3         | Winston  |
| 1         | Jonathan |
+-----------+----------+
Explanation: 
Alice and Bob do not have a unique ID, We will show null instead.
The unique ID of Meir is 2.
The unique ID of Winston is 3.
The unique ID of Jonathan is 1.


CODE:
Select unique_id, name
from Employees
left join EmployeeUNI
on if (Employees.id = EmployeeUNI.id, Employees.id, null)


1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products
Table: Products

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.

 Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.

Code: 
select product_id from Products
where low_fats = 'Y' and recyclable = 'Y'
